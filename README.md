This Repository will contain different mini applications that I will create in order for me to learn and familiarize myself with the Python language

# Dice
This is my first mini project that I am creating in Python. What I hope to gain from it is experience on how the language works and knwoledge on the different types of things I could create compared to Java.

This program should:
  - Take user input
  - Randomize dice and total the two
  - Return winner of dice game

# Year 100
This program was created to take the users age and return the year that they will be 100 years old. One thing I learned from this mini project was that there is a difference between raw_input() and input(). One takes a string and the other takes an integer.
